###### SDN platform to be built on a kubernetes cluster

### Cluster requirements
|Purpose     | Count | Memory | vCPU|
|:----------:|:-----:|:------:|:---:|
|ODL         |   3   |   8    |  4  |
|k8s masters |   3   |   4    |  2  |
|HAProxy     |   3*  |   2    |  2  |
|High perf   |   4   |   32   |  8  |
|Medium perf |   4   |   16   |  4  |
\* It is possible to deploy the platform using only 1 HAProxy instead of a cluster

### Deployment
1) Create ssh key pair
1) Create corresponding VMs. In case they are created in a cloud platform, make sure you add the ssh public key during creation 
2) Make sure python is installed on every VM
3) Modify vars.yaml file accordingly
4) If not already done so, copy ssh public key to all the VMs
5) Build the kubernetes cluster
```
cd ansible-playbooks
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e sshkey=SSHKEY_PATH k8s-cluster-deployment/main.yaml 
```
6) Before deploying nm2 services, edit monitoring/manifest-all.yaml (line 3136) by setting the haproxy vIP address accordingly
7) If there's an instance of rook already running, comment role rook within nm2-deployment/main.yaml
8) Deploy NM2
```
cd ansible-playbooks
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e sshkey=SSHKEY_PATH nm2-deployment/main.yaml 
```
